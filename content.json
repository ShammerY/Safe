"I am the bone of my sword.\nSteel is my body and fire is my blood.\nI have created over a thousand blades.\nUnknown to death, nor known to life.\nHave withstood pain to create many weapons.\nYet, those hands will never hold anything.\nSo as i pray, unlimited blade works.\n_______________________________________\n\nVosmet vetat res coelica\nIam premet ietum vastum te\nvae gniari sunt suimet quis in oculis\n##\nSapientes feroces\nvetitum per currunt nefas.\nTarda leti et necessitas semota corripiet gradum.\nIugis\nSolum\nIpsius\nNihil Debet\nCave vide qua sunt edicta inutile\nDominatus\nDominatus\nDominatus\n##\nVae eis simulacrum in solio inanis\nfixere sapientes necessitas semota corripiet gradum.\nNumquam Genitus Desiderem.\n____________________________________________\n\nShut your heart, shut your eyes.\nDont be scared, shut your eyes.\nWatch those lights, from the stars.\nWith your head hypnotized.\nJoin our fight, for whats right.\nWIsh your heart, be in your guide.\n\n________________________________________\n\nToo long, too long to fear the sun.\nToo long to live a perfect day\nAlone to sing a song.\n\nAnd now, i wonder if i could.\nI wonder if i should beleive.\nThis night goes on and on.\n\nImagine you are fine.\nImagine you are rambling\nIn a severe cold, a million years of snow.\n\nThe heart is beating slow.\nThe temperature goes low\nThe winter lies without the sound\n\nIn a day, i lost in the falling stars.\nThey dance in a holly darkness.\nIf my larva era last forever.\nMortal stories od thousand stargaze,\nLife is a noisy careless, but the quiet loneliness.\n\nWho will take the night to the icy ocean,\nfrozen and sunk in water?\nIt was possible to live forever.\nAll i can is to remember, the simple phrase.\nThe longest night will have an end.\n"
